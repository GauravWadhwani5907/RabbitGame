[The Rabbit Game](https://studio.code.org/projects/spritelab/cyUBZDR4qHNbZzsZXgmvwCJQgeNynO79jjNmfHbicbU)

It is a rabbit game that was constructed using the Code.org platform, which was built using Blockly.
You will proceed to the game that is officially hosted on the Code.org platform when you click the provided game link, where you will find the game's instructions.
The game begins by pushing the down button first. By doing so, you will see a rabbit against a rainbow background. 
When you press the Up button in the second stage, a carrot will appear somewhere random.
The third and last stage is to hit the Right button. When you press the Right button, the Rabbit moves to the location of the Carrot. When it reaches that area, the Carrot is removed, and the size of the Rabbit rises by 10 and when it reaches a size of 250 or more, it will shrink down to a size of 100 and a notification saying "I am full please restart" will be shown.
